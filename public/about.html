<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Keith Welch — a former Steel Detailer turned Web Developer.</p>

<p>My background in steel detailing gave me a strong foundation in precision, problem-solving, and clear communication. I
learned how to manage complex projects, work within tight specifications, and deliver results that meet both technical
and creative needs.</p>

<p>Now, I apply those same skills to web development. I focus on building clean, efficient, and user-friendly websites and
applications that deliver real value. I’m passionate about creating digital solutions that work seamlessly while
offering a great user experience.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, I’m usually exploring new technologies, refining my skills, or tackling side projects that
challenge me to grow as a developer.I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly. I want to
become a team player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products!</p>

<p>I’m excited to keep building, learning, and collaborating on projects that make an impact.</p>
